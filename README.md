Steps:
1. Download dataset and extract to subfolder dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kWz4IJw9V3Vt8BIbkO6rj8wDUk2X0E0p?usp=sharing
2. Open train.py and check the configuration setting
3. Python3 train.py, model and other metadata will be saved in subfolder model
4. Python3 predict.py, prediction result will be saved in subfolder prediction


To do list:
1. Train-val-test for NuScenes dataset
